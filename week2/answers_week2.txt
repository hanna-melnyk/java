Your name(s):

Please submit your textual answers to the following questions in this file:
- P-2.2 
You will deﬁne a JAVA class to model your three-way lamp. What query (or queries) should the class
support? Which commands?
It should contain variable lampState, and have methods: printState(), nextState(), printHelp()


- P-2.9
1. In which package is the String class contained? java.lang.String >> lang package
2. How many constructors does this class have? How do they differ?  >> 60 methods, 15 constructors
3. Several methods can be used to construct new String instances, which are often called factory
methods because they ’produce’ objects. How many methods are available that build String in-
stances? >> 

Strings are immutable; their values cannot be changed after they are created. 
But there are several methods that can be used to construct new String instances.
There are 11 of them. For example: substring(int beginIndex), toLowerCase() 


- P-2.11 In ECLIPSE, run the ss.week2.test.GuestTest JUNIT tests that you downloaded from Canvas
(see Exercise P-2.8) in order to test your implementation. Explain what happens.


The GuestTest checks whether my code satisfies all the requirements when running the methods: setting the names, checking the guest in, checking the guest into a taken room, checking the guest out, checking the unknown guest out. The failure is due to missing functionality in the Guest class. We have only created a stub implementation of the Guest class in previous exercise, but tests expect Guest to have features that haven't been implemented yet.


P-2.13 Generate JavaDoc documentation for your project. Once the documentation is generated, you can
open the ﬁle doc/index.html to start browsing the documentation. Which information is included in the
JavaDoc documentation? Explain why JavaDoc can be useful.

html includes summary of all of the Classes, packages, methods, variables, etc inside of a project, based on my comments in Java code. It is convenient to use it for overview of the project. It gives an idea of the project features, without having to scroll through all of the code lines of it.
